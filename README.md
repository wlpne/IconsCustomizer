An advanced Xposed/LSPosed module designed to bring ultimate icon customization to the HyperOS Launcher. Break free from default icons and apply any custom third-party icon pack directly to your system launcher.

> **⚠️ Developer Note:**
> I originally created this project for my own personal use. Please do not expect immediate updates or quick bug fixes! If you run into issues, feel free to report them on [GitHub Issues](../../issues) or on my Reddit post, and I will try my best to fix them whenever I have free time.

> **⚠️ Notice:**
> This is a *fork* maintained by [wlpne](https://github.com/wlpne). I created it to fix the scope issue for global ROM's (especially for POCO Launcher [com.mi.android.globallauncher])
